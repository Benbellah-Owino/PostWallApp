This is a corner store version of twitter built using SvelteJS,ExpressJS and MongoDB. 
It is a personal project to help me polish my skills and I also enjoy making it.
Add your mongouri,PORT number and  refresh_secret in a .env file in the backend directory.
To have it running navigate to frontend in one terminal and run this command -> npm run dev
Then navigate to backend and run this command in another terminal -> npm start 
Now enjoy and play around with it.

NB: Remember to fork it and don't make any changes on the main branch
I'll make the code more readable as time goes on.
